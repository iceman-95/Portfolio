## 👋 About Me

I’m a mathematician, researcher, and data professional with over 5 years of programming experience. I mainly work with **Python** to build applications for machine learning, data analysis, backend tools, and CLI systems. While Python is my main language, I also use **JavaScript** for interactive projects.  

My background combines both **academia and industry**:  
- At **ViaBill** and **UtiliSave LLC**, I worked as a Data Analyst, where I analyzed real-world datasets, built dashboards, automated reports, and helped discover useful insights.  
- During my **PhD in Mathematics**, I used advanced models and computational methods to study complex problems, tested results with Python, and presented them in a clear way—experience that connects well to today’s data workflows.  

I use tools like **Cursor**, Git, and modular coding styles to keep my projects clean, testable, and easy to maintain. This helps me focus more on **logic, usability, and design**, instead of repetitive tasks.  

Outside of the technical side, I’m a **curious and motivated person** who enjoys working with others, sharing knowledge, and solving problems through code. I learn quickly and adapt well to new environments, especially where both **analytical thinking** and **practical solutions** are needed.
