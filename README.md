## 🔬 About Me

I am a mathematical researcher focused on harmonic analysis, non-standard function spaces, and integral operators. I hold a PhD in Mathematics from Georgian Technical University and currently work as a researcher at the A. Razmadze Mathematical Institute of Ivane Javakhishvili Tbilisi State University.

My current interests include:
- One-sided fractional and singular integral operators
- Variable exponent and Morrey-type spaces
- Weighted norm inequalities and trace estimates
