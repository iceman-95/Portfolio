## 👋 About Me

I’m a mathematician, researcher, and software/data enthusiast with 5+ years of hands-on programming experience. I specialise in building **production-ready applications** using **Python** for backend systems, machine learning prototypes, data analysis, and CLI tools. While Python is my primary language, I also work with **JavaScript**.

My academic research focused on **advanced mathematical modelling and rigorous problem-solving**, developing complex proofs, and tackling abstract theoretical challenges. These experiences strengthened my **analytical thinking, logical reasoning, and attention to detail**, which are highly relevant to modern **data workflows**: understanding structures, modeling relationships, and deriving insights.  

I use **Cursor**, Git, and modular architecture to keep code structured, testable, and clean—allowing me to focus on **logic, usability, and design** while automating repetitive tasks. Beyond technical skills, I’m a **curious, collaborative, and motivated learner** who enjoys tackling challenging problems and adapting quickly to new environments.
