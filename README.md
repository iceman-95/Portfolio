## 👋 About Me
I’m a mathematician, researcher, and software/data developer with 5+ years of hands-on programming experience. I specialise in building **production-ready applications** using **Python** for machine learning, data analysis, backend systems, and CLI tools. While Python is my main language, I also work with **JavaScript**.

In my academic research, I applied **advanced statistical and computational methods** to analyse complex datasets, build mathematical models, validate results through Python simulations, and present findings at conferences. These experiences directly translate to modern **data workflows**: data preprocessing, modelling, validation, and clear communication of insights.

I use **Cursor**, Git, and modular architecture to keep code structured, testable, and clean—allowing me to focus on **logic, usability, and design** while automating repetitive parts. Beyond technical skills, I’m a **curious, collaborative, and motivated learner** who enjoys solving real-world problems through code and adapting quickly to new environments.
