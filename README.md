## 👋 About Me

I'm a mathematician and researcher with 5+ years of hands-on programming experience. I specialize in building **production-ready applications** using **Python** for machine learning, data analysis, backend tools, and CLI systems. While Python is my main language, I’ve also worked with **JavaScript**. I use **Cursor** to speed up development while keeping my code structured, testable, and clean. It helps me focus more on logic, usability, and design while automating repetitive parts. Beyond technical skills, I'm a **friendly**, **curious**, and **highly motivated** person who enjoys working with others, learning new tools, and solving real-world problems through code. I'm used to both **teaching others** and **learning from teams**, and I adapt quickly to new environments.
